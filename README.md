# Character Recognition Using Perceptron

This project implements a single-layer perceptron for recognizing characters represented as bipolar patterns, based on Example 2.14 from Fundamentals of Neural Networks by Laurene Fausett (pp. 71â€“76). The perceptron is trained using the standard learning rule to adjust its weights and correctly classify input patterns corresponding to the letters A, B, C, D, E, J, and K.

The implementation is written in Python using NumPy and demonstrates how a perceptron can learn to distinguish character patterns, even when presented with variations from different fonts. It provides a clear, hands-on example of fundamental neural network learning principles and can be easily explored in a Jupyter Notebook for educational purposes.
